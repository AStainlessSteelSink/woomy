# Woomy
Woomy is a all-purpose discord bot built off the [guidebot](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot) base and coded in node.js using discord.js. 

# How to use
The easiest way to use Woomy is to invite it to your server with [this link.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=435961704145485835&permissions=2134240503&scope=bot) It is hosted 24/7 and automatically updates itself when a new release is made available, making sure you always get the newest features.

Self hosting is generally not recommended, but instructions are provided below if you still wish to do so. Woomy's code will need to be modified before it will run on your machine.

# Requirements
- git
- node.js v12.0.0 or higher
- node-gyp build tools
- ffmpeg

# Installation
- Clone Woomy to your machine
- Run `npm i` in Woomy's directory
- Open config.js in your code editor and insert all the required information
