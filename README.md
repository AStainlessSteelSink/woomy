# woomy-next
Rewrite of Woomy's codebase, because I'm getting really sick of working on shitty two year-old code. If you aren't a developer, please switch back to the master branch!
# notes for devs
- please install ESLint and use the included .eslintrc.js file to have properly formatted code when you're writing Woomy
