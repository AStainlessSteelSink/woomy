# woomy-next
Rewrite of Woomy's codebase, because I'm getting really sick of working on shitty two year-old code. If you aren't a developer, please switch back to the master branch!
# notes for devs
- config.js no longer stores tokens, for that you will need to use a .env file.
- please use the StandardJS linter when writing code for Woomy.
